Python Games

Hi there!

I'm Abraham and this is my first python project.
I got the idea of doing this instead of anything else when I found this video on a FreeCodeCamp article:

This may not seem too proffesional but I lost all my old CLI games and other programs (C and C++) I did since highschool. This time I'm smarther than that.
Since I wanted to learn a new language, but not in the mood to make something bigger or more complex tbh, I fell in love with the idea of getting into it the same way it all started for me.

Stay tuned, I'm making this projects again in javaScript, some modifications will be applied in order to make it browser friendly.
Also, I'll start eventually another repo with bash games (emulating what my memory says I did in C/C++ like 20 years ago).

N.B.: I'll edit/format it later.
